#Population Statistics

Step 1: Obtain coverage distribution 

Step 1.5: Calculate coverage threshod

Step 2: Produce coverage+repeat genomic masking information

Step 3: Calculate individual heterozygosity by 1MB blocks

Step 4: Calculate distribution of homozygote-stretch lengths

Step 5: Calculate shared heterozygosity between individual pairs
